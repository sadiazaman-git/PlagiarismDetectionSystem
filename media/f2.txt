Most of sea water, therefore, is just water, that is, pure water.
But it contains some other substances as well and the best known of these is
salt. Salt is a substance the molecules of which contain atoms of sodium and
of chlorine. That is why sea water is about 1.1 percent sodium and about
2.1 percent chlorine. There are some other kinds of atoms in sea water, as
you would expect, for it gets all the substances which the waters of the earth
dissolve and carry down to it but they are unimportant in amounts.
