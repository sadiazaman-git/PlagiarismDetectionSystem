majority of sea water is simply pure water, with other
substances mixed in. The most wellknown of these other substances is salt.
Salt is made up of molecules, which are made up of sodium and chlorine atoms. This is the reason for sea water being 1.1 percent sodium and 2.1
percent chlorine. In addition to salt, there are other atoms present in sea
water. Obviously, sea water contains all of the substances which the waters
of the earth dissolve and carry down. But, these substances are present in
insignificant amounts.
